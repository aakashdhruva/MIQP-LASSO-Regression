# Non-Linear Programming for Variable Selection in Regression

## Project Overview
This project delves into the realm of predictive analytics, specifically focusing on the variable selection problem in regression. Using both Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) and LASSO regression, the project aims to compare these two approaches in terms of their efficacy and practical application in statistical modeling.

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: The project begins with rigorous data preparation, involving reading, shuffling, and splitting of the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **Optimization Techniques**: The core of the project lies in applying MIQP for direct variable selection and LASSO regression for indirect variable selection, followed by a thorough comparison of these methods.

## Technical Details
- **Libraries Used**: The implementation leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy for data handling, Gurobi for optimization, scikit-learn for regression modeling and cross-validation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- **Key Code Snippets**: The notebook includes important snippets showcasing the setup and execution of both MIQP and LASSO models, cross-validation processes, and error analysis.

## Results and Analysis
- **Model Comparison**: The project provides an in-depth comparison between MIQP and LASSO, focusing on their performance based on cross-validation metrics and their predictions on the test dataset.
- **Visualizations**: The report features various graphs and charts that effectively communicate the results of the models and highlight key comparisons.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project sheds light on the advantages and disadvantages of direct variable selection (MIQP) versus indirect approaches (LASSO) in regression analysis, offering insights into their applicability in predictive analytics.

## Appendices
Additional notes and extended analysis can be found in the latter sections of the notebook.
